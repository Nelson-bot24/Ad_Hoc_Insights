# Ad_Hoc_Insights
## Company: AtliQ Hardwares
AtliQ Hardwares is an imaginary leading computer hardware producer in India with a global presence. The company is committed to leveraging data analytics to drive smart, data-informed decisions.
## Challenge
AtliQ Hardwares identified a gap in their ability to make quick, smart data-informed decisions. To bridge this gap, they aimed to expand their data analytics team by hiring junior data analysts proficient in both technical and soft skills. Tony Sharma, their Data Analytics Director, devised a SQL challenge to evaluate these skills.
## My Task
As a hypothetical applicant for this role, I was tasked with:

Reviewing the ad-hoc-requests.pdf, which contained 10 ad hoc business requests requiring insights.
Writing and executing SQL queries to answer these requests.
Creating a presentation to showcase these insights, targeting top-level management.
